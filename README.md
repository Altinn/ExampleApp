Altinn
=========
The Altinn project (https://www.altinn.no/en/) is aimed at replacing the paper based communication between the government, citizens and businesses with an electronic internet based system.

Altinn is a web portal and technical platform for delivering electronic forms to the government, but also offers other services such as messages from the government and insight into public registers. The portal was started as cooperation between The Norwegian Tax Department, Statistics Norway and The Brønnøysund Register in 2003
